## Hello, world!

This is a new, beautiful, elegant, modifiable and modular terminal, in the development of which everyone can take part. You can create something new, you can modify something, or you can play with the settings by adding your own. Or you can just play around with the themes and colors of the terminal. You can do with the terminal what you want to do.

## Why the project?

The project is needed for testing, debugging, and selecting functionality that will be included in the release and beta versions of the hterminal desktop project. This project is designed as a sandbox: play, create, build. But only the most necessary things will get into the final.

## Modularity, modifiability, flexibility.

The application can be modified, customized, add its own modules, commands, easily use all the functions of the application, and much more. You can implement anything: from simple possibilities to the most enormous.

## A note for developers

If you would like to develop the hterminal and memphis project (development of experiments before their implementation in hterminal), please contact us. We are looking for talented guys to join our team.
